Deepin Storm is download library and tool for Linux Deepin project.

There's have many awesome download tool in Linux, but python binding is suck!

I just need a neat multi-threads download library and easy to use, that's all!

Depend:
sudo aptitude install python-gevent

gevent-1.0.x still have many bug, so newer version (deepin_storm_for_1.0.x) can't work, 
I will test again when gevent-1.0 offical version release.
